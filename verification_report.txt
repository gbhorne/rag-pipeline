  PHASE 2 COMPLETE — Full RAG Pipeline with ChromaDB
  ============================================================
  
  What YOU built:
    1. Chunking     — split documents into overlapping pieces
    2. Embedding    — converted text to vectors (gemini-embedding-001)
    3. Vector Store — stored vectors in ChromaDB
    4. Retrieval    — similarity search to find relevant chunks
    5. Generation   — built grounded prompt, called Gemini
  
  What Vertex AI did in Phase 1 (same steps, managed):
    1. ChunkingConfig     → automatic chunking on upload
    2. text-embedding-004 → automatic embedding on upload
    3. Cloud Spanner      → managed vector database
    4. retrieval_query()  → managed similarity search
    5. Tool.from_retrieval → automatic prompt building
  
  THE RAG PATTERN IS THE SAME.
  Only the infrastructure layer changed.
